v2.5 https://github.com/realXtend/naali/compare/tundra2.4.1...tundra2.5
------
- Undo/redo functionality in scene editing.
- Optional interest management system implemented into server->client scene updates. Configurable from the command line or with the interest management settings dialog. Contributed by Kari Vatjus-Anttila.
- Update to Bullet 2.8.1 and physics rolling friction support for EC_RigidBody. Contributed by Peter C.
- Update to Qt 4.8.4 on Windows.
- Update to OpenSSL 0.9.8x on Windows. Contributed by Peter C.
- Official support for compiling on Visual Studio 2010 and cleanup of the Windows dependencies build script.
- Support for compiling without Boost (TUNDRA_NO_BOOST CMake define). Cleanup of Tundra codebase of Boost-specific constructs.
- Per-rigidbody gravity enable/disable.
- Wire protocol resiliency for adding component attributes to the end of a component's attribute list while maintaining future version compatibility.
  Unfortunately Tundra 2.4.x can not retroactively support this and is incompatible eg. with the EC_RigidBody component.
- For consistency, signal individual component removals also when an entity is being removed from the scene. This may simplify eg. script code checking for removal of specific components.
- Added a Javascript Tundra1 -> Tundra2 scene orientation converter.
- Several bugfixes and convenience improvements in the API.

v2.1.2
------
 - https://github.com/realXtend/naali/compare/tundra2.1.0...tundra2.1.2

v2.1.0 - https://github.com/realXtend/naali/compare/tundra2.0.0...tundra2.1.0
------
 - http://groups.google.com/group/realxtend-dev/browse_thread/thread/7671cc73135d28ba/44310921bf5583e0

v2.0.0 - https://github.com/realXtend/naali/compare/tundra1.0.8...tundra2.0.0
------
Deleted code and deprecations.
 - Deleted EventManager and the internal event system queue mechanism
(EventManager.h, IEventData.h). Direct signal-slots are used instead, as
they are more convenient.
    - Rewrote all uses of EventManager to provide a proper signalling API,
e.g. in TundraLogicModule Server.cpp and Client.cpp.
 - Deleted obsolete ConfigurationManager.
 - Deleted ServiceManager and the concept of services.
 - Deleted UiServiceInterface.
 - Deleted rotten EC_BillboardWidget, EC_MovableTextOverlay.
 - Deleted dependency to the PoCo library altogether, and other smaller
3rd party libraries like curl.
 - Removed the use of GetModuleManager wherever applicable. Modules are
queried directly through Framework::GetModule, not via a separate
manager.
 - Deleted EC_ChatBubble, EC_Clone, EC_Gizmo, EC_Ruler, EC_Selected,
EC_VideoSource, EC_3DCanvas, EC_3DCanvasSource, EC_Videosource. These
features can be reimplemented as plugins proper outside of core.
 - Deleted the folder EC_3DGizmo, which has gone unused.
 - Deleted PhononPlayerModule, ScenePersistenceModule, UpdateModule,
pending a refresh to the new plugin mechanism.
 - Deleted CAVEStereoModule, pending a refresh to the new plugin mechanism.
 - Deleted IntervalTimer and LockFreeList core objects (unused).
 - Deprecated OgreRendererService (currently under the name IRenderer),
replaced with the mechanism below.
 - Deprecated the concept of 'current active scene' and 'the default
scene'. Instead, use a single 'current active camera on the main UI'
query.
 - Removed hash-based asset reload checks and booleans for isLoaded.
 - Deleted badly placed Renderer::RenderAvatar.
 - Deleted QGraphicsEffects from UiProxyWidget.
 - Deleted Platform.h, PlatformNix.h, PlatformWin.h as unneeded.
 - Deleted unused Root logging functionality and Framework thread task
mechanism.
 - Removal of several **Raw workarounds. (more still exist, which should
be rid of asap)
 - Removed all legacy code that was unmaintained, unused or otherwise
badly implemented to be harmful to use. Core code should either implement
properly or not at all - temporary hacks will not be accepted without a
very good reason.
 
Solution reorganization
 - Deleted the obsolete projects Foundation, Interfaces, RexCommon.
 - Deleted the obsolete projects InWorldChatModule, InventoryModule,
RpcUtilities, RexLogicModule, ProtocolUtilities, ProtocolModuleOpenSim,
ProtocolModuleTaiga, HttpUtilities and Core.
 - Deleted the obsolete components EC_HoveringWidget, EC_NetworkPosition,
EC_OpenSimPresence, EC_OpenSimPrim.
 - Removed SceneStructureModule and moved all its contents to
ECEditorModule (these two always come together or not at all).
 - Moved EC_InputMapper to Input project.
 - Moved EC_DynamicComponent to Scene project.
 - Grouped EC_SoundListener and EC_Sound to same project to improve
compilation times.
 - Moved EC_Light to OgreRenderingModule.
 - Deleted the use of PCH in all EntityComponents projects in which it
doesn't help compilation times.
 - Replaced server.exe and viewer.exe with a single tundra.exe, uses
--server parameter to decide whether to start a server, and --config
viewer.xml if to start a client viewer UI.
 
New Plugin API (mostly never used directly)
 - New plugin mechanism for a simpler and more flexible plugin
implementation.
 - Implemented a new plugins.xml to configure the set of modules and
startup .js files to load. Use --config startup parameter to specify the
set of modules to load.
 - Removed the module description XML files and startup-time sorting based
on dependencies.
 
Finished the work on Asset API
 - Fixed several bugs where storages, providers and disk sources were not
remembered for assets when taking them from the web cache.
 - Unify the handling different asset ref forms into Asset API.
 - Implemented an Asset Ref resolving step, where a relative ref is
resolved (possibly inside some context) to an absolute ref.
 - Reimplemented the signalling flow of asset downloads to guarantee a
coherent signal flow independent of how an asset is loaded.
    - some changes to signals to remove ambiguity, e.g. renamed
IAssetTransfer::Loaded() to IAssetTransfer::Succeeded() to avoid
confusion with IAsset::Loaded().
 - Implemented context-based relative asset handling to allow relative
dependencies between assets to work properly
 - Implemented asset refs to named asset storages which allows scenes to
be transferred from one server to another without having to manually
search&replace script refs.
 - Implemented subassetname specifications to assetrefs to allow pointing
to a part of an asset inside an asset.
 - Implemented asset storage synchronization on login to be able to refer
to assets using relative names or named storage specifiers on the server.
 - Implemented a push-based asset update notification mechanism (e.g.
alongside HTTP storages) so clients automatically know to fetch the
newest version of an asset as soon as it is available.
 - Implemented a text serialization mechanism ("serialized storage
strings") for systematically handling configuration for different types
of asset storages
 - Implemented an asset discovery mechanism that synchronizes folders of
assets from a networked storage (e.g. using PROPFIND when over HTTP).
 - Formalized the concept of an Empty asset: URL to fetch is known,
neither loaded or locally cached data is available.
 - Formalized the concept of an Unloaded asset: URL to fetch is known,
data is available locally, but the contents are offloaded from (GPU)
memory.
 - Added a null asset factory (e.g. for headless mode), and removed
several IsHeadless() checks sprinkled in hardcoded places.
 - Deleted the decoding step of an asset transfer (decoding occurs on
asset load)
 
New math library (float2, float3, float4, float3x3, float3x4, float4x4, Quat)
 - Automatically generated bindings instead of manual ones.
 - Removed manually written Transform, Quaternion and Vector QScriptValue
bindings.
 - Remove use of previous Irrlicht math code which lacked in features and
used inconsistent conventions
 - Math objects for geometric computations, symmetric in C++ and QtScript.
(AABB, OBB, Sphere, Line, LineSegment, Ray, Triangle, Plane)
 - Example preliminary documentation here
http://clb.demon.fi/dump/DocGenerator/
 
Reimplemented environment-related functionality.
 - SkyX and HydraX integration.
 - Deleted the use of Caelum altogether, replaced with SkyX (optionally).
 - Deleted all badly structured EC_Skybox, EC_SkyDome, EC_SkyPlane,
Sky-templates.h.
 - Deleted rotten EC_OgreEnvironment and EC_OgreSky.
 - Reimplemented EC_Sky as a more generic attribute-based sky component
when SkyX is not used.
 
Avatar
 - Implemented AvatarDescAsset and EC_Avatar to use the Asset API.
 - Reimplemented avatar script as a more extensible way to allow extending
own animation playback and controlling which built-in behavior is used
and when.
 - Simplified the mechanism how avatar description files refer to other
assets.
 - Partially reimplemented the avatar editor against the mechanism.
 - Removed object camera/tripod camera controls from the avatar script,
they need to be separate applications (or optionally removable).
 - Deleted old EC_AvatarAppearance, EC_Controllable, EC_OpenSimAvatar
components and other obsolete avatar uploading functionality.
 
Reimplemented Console API
 - Deleted the old ConsoleCommandStruct registration mechanism.
 - Implemented console commands to operate directly on Qt slots.
 - Moved FunctionInvoker to core to enable the above. Will be used for
entity actions as well in the future.
 - Autocompletion suggestions.
 - Enable browsing previously typed commands.
 - Deleted MODULE_LOGGING_FUNCTIONS #define macros and reimplemented
logging via much simpler means.
 - Deleted DEFINE_LOGGING_FUNCTIONS.
 
More robust asset support
 - Implemented script-accessible modification functions for TextureAsset
(SetContents, SetContentsDrawText, SetContentsFill, QImage interop)
 - Exposed OgreMaterialAsset material specifications for C++ and QtScripts.
 - Reimplemented asset editors for textures, meshes, materials and
particle scripts, with syntax highlighting support.
 - Added support for the handling of relative refs to ParticleAsset,
QtUiAsset, Script and OgreMaterialAssets.
 - Implemented QtUiAsset::Instantiate() to be used over
UiApi::LoadFromFile wherever applicable.
 
New component factory mechanism
 - Removed ComponentManager, DECLARE_EC and DECLARE_MODULE_EC.
 - Deleted Foundation.h, IComponentRegistrar.h,
 - Implemented a new simpler registrable component factory similar to
asset factories.
 
More robust component types
 - Implemented EC_Material which allows replicated modification of
materials e.g. for animation purposes.
 - Reimplemented EC_HoveringText with more features and control over how
text is generated. Removed hardcoded animation logic in the component
that is more flexibly implemented in scripts.
 - Reimplemented EC_Highlight with attribute-based features.
 - Improved EC_ParticleSystem to work with AssetRefListener.
 - Renamed EC_OgreCamera to EC_Camera and filled it with utility functions
(GetMouseRay(), IsObjectVisible()) and attributes (up vector). Refactored
it to use the new math classes.
 - Implemented isKinematic property for EC_Rigidbody.
 - Switched convex hull generation code due to critical bugs in the
previous algorithm.
 - Deleted PostProcessWidget. Improved EC_OgreCompositor to enable
asset-based compositors.
 - Added a sample demo UI to bin/scenes/Compositor/ to showcase the
different compositors.
 - Remove hashing from component type names to prepare for new optimized
sync protocol implementation.
 - Reimplemented EC_Billboard to support attributes and AssetRefListener.
 - Removed IComponent::IsSerializable() - all components are serializable.
 
Likely breaking changes
 - Reimplemented and simplified EC_Placeable which had became a
inconsistent mess of random conveniency functions. Now math code is
properly handled in the new math classes instead of built-in into
EC_Placeable functions.
 - Removed the use of hardcoded conversion scenenodes in the scene graph
to flip y<->z. Now all input data is used as-is without runtime
conversions. Reimplemented asset importers to not perform swap hacks.
 - Core API function naming refactored to be more consistent in all classes.
 - Deleted Entity::HasComponent. (just call Entity::GetComponent and test
for null).
 - Deleted the excessive use of namespaces throughout the core API - they
aren't needed, and make code much more verbose than it needs to be.
 - Deleted SceneAPI::GetSceneRaw.
 - Deleted Entity::GetComponentRaw().
 
Refactored the core scene structure to support additional augmented scene
views of the core scene:
 - OgreWorld contains the Ogre-specific data of the core scene
 - PhysicsWorld contains the Bullet-specific data of the scene
 - Users can register their own scenes, in case the
entity-component-attribute mechanism is limiting.
 - Exposed to scripts as "scene.ogre." and "scene.physics." objects.
Operates as the primary interface of
   both visibility- and physics -related scene queries for scripts.
 - Implemented frustum-based visibility queries for scripts along the
raycast queries.
 - Implemented OnEnterView and OnLeaveView -mechanisms to allow scripts
and plugins to implement visibility-based optimization on their script
logic.
 
Editor improvements
 - Enabled changing entities' temporary status from Scene Structure window.
 - Enabled changing entities' local/replicated status from Scene Structure
window.
 - Enabled a dialog-based "..."-selection for assets in the EC editor
asset refs.
 - Added "E"-button to ECEditor to open an asset in an asset ref to an
editor.
 - Enable cloning assets from the editor.
 - Show asset status in Assets window.
 - Added "Do not alter asset references" option to scene import dialog,
which leaves relative asset refs intact.
 
Other API and misc. changes
 - Added Entity::Clone()
 - Deleted Renderer::RepaintUi().
 - Added FunctionDialog for the Assets menu for accessing functions from
individual assets, providers and storages from the UI.
 - Added IAssetStorage::Type()
 - Removed Framework::GetModuleQObj with Framework::GetModuleByName,
exposed IModule to scripts.
 - Added script access for specifying exact EC_AnimationController
animation timing parameters.
 - Fixed EC_VolumeTrigger to actually work.
 - Optimized OgreMaterialAsset clones to do a direct in-memory copy
instead of going through disk.
 - Implemented a separate RedirectedPaintWidget for optimized Qt UI
blitting in certain cases.
 - Fixed Profiler crashes and issues where it lost some profiling blocks.
 - Deleted UiApi::AddWidgetToSceneRaw.
 - Reimplemented the managing of important directory paths to centralized
functions:
   - Application::SetCurrentWorkingDirectory().
   - Application::CurrentWorkingDirectory()
   - Application::InstallationDirectory()
   - Application::UserDataDirectory()
   - Application::UserDocumentsDirectory().
 - Implemented and tested unicode support for path handling.
 - Reimplemented all code to use the abovementioned folders instead of
assuming cwd is some specific directory, to prepare to run Tundra
in-process in a web browser plugin.
 - Deleted AssetModule::AddHttpStorage and replaced it with a more generic
AssetModule::AddAssetStorage which uses serialized storage strings.
 - Deleted poorly structured IAssetProvider::AddStorage, replaced by
serialized storage strings.
 - Reimplemented frame-time limiter to sleep inside Qt's event loop
instead of the Ogre renderer.
 - Implemented IAssetStorage::GetAllAssetRefs() to enable querying storage
contents.
 - Fixed SceneManager entity ID allocation to return guaranteedly unique
IDs. Added runtime checks for known critical (but never yet seen) bugs in
SyncManager.
 
Input API improvements.
 - Tied the setting of mouse cursor to InputContexts so that they get
cleaned up after contexts are deleted or overridden by priority, to avoid
commonly seen user bugs where an override is never cleared.
 - Implemented InputAPI::MousePos.
 - Reimplemented mouse double click handling in InputAPI, deleted related
test booleans.
 - Treat input as being over Qt when mouse cursor is hidden
 
Entity parenting support.
- Implemented support for parenting entities to other entities or bones of
meshes.
- Implemented EntityReference attribute type.
- Added EC_Mesh::GetAvailableBones().
- Implemented script-accessible support for querying mesh bone transforms.

v1.0.8 - https://github.com/realXtend/naali/compare/tundra1.0.7...tundra1.0.8
------
 - New Kinect, joystick and wiimote code. This is still experimental work but the supporting python code is now there. We are not yet shipping the needed DLLs but you are free to try on your own. We will ship the needed DLLs once the python code is working properly under windows.
 - Code for ARModule: Simple support for augmented reality things. You can feed your reality camera feed to the background of the scene. The module also provides a simple EC that controls the depth/color buffer write for the entitys mesh. This module is not shipped (yet) with the installer. You can build it from sources if you want to experiment, ask more from Pforce on IRC.
 - Code for MobilityModule: Utilizes QtModility to get information about battery state, connectivity etc. This information can be used for login in scripts. This module is not yet shipped, but you can build it from souces if you want to experiment. Will possibly ship for windows releases in the future when refined a bit, as this will be useful for laptops.
 - Cave/StereoModule: Added new stereoscopy modes: Horizontal, Vertical and Checkboard. Also added functionality to flip the rendering on these modes.
 - NullRenderer Ogre plugin: This plugin is used in headless mode (on windows only for now). Eliminates the need to have directx on server machines. Also loads the OgreRender module nicely without a remote GUI for a windows servers. This enables programs to start a tundra server on the desktop space without having a active remote to the server, also enables things like autorestarting on crashes if you want to implement something like this. The plugin will be enabled on linux aswell once tested properly there.
 - EC_WebView: Added illuminating attribute to control the lighting of a webview texture. If enabled the material/texture is emissive (emitting light basically) so its readable also in dark conditions. Enabled by default.
 - Avatar (simpleavatar.js) applications camera now evades obstables. Camera should not go outside of walls/obstacles so that you cannot see your avatar anymore. Supporting raycast functions added to OgreRenderer::Renderer.
 - SlideSircle example scene got a lot of updates from therauli.
 - OgreRenderer now prints what plugins it loads succesfully and also what rendering plugin it takes into use. Useful if you want to know if you are actually running dx or opengl etc.
 - The "get back" buttons of object focus mode and freefly are now alot smaller and semi transparent so they wont hide the scene too much.
 - EC_RigidBody: Added toggle functions for gravityEnabled for single entities. Added InterpolateUpwards function that forces the body not to flip over.
 - EC_Placeable: More script exposing.
 - IControlDevice: Added new interface for DevicesAPI that joysticks and other controller can utilise, has nice signals for control devices versus the plain IDevice.
 - EC_LaserPointer: All lasers were tracking all clients, so it was a mess to use this. Also now hides the laser if you go on top of UI or outside the main window rect.
 - Alt+Left Mouse Click on objects now focuses on the click position not the mesh origin.
 - When going into object focus mode stop the avatar movement and rotation.
 - EC_HoveringText: Fix couple crash bugs where image size was not validated before pushed to ogre.

v1.0.7 - https://github.com/realXtend/naali/compare/tundra1.0.6...tundra1.0.7
------
 - New framework update logic that has a frame limiter that does not use thread sleep anymore. This will let Qt:s main loop breath a bit more resulting in more responsive ui and make rendering fps more steady. You can set the fps with start param --fpslimiter as usual.
 - The in viewer web browser now has disk cache, disk icon database and cookie support to speed up browsing and to be more pleasant with cookies. The cache/cookie settings can be modified from the browser settings ui, they can both be also cleared from there.
 - The in viewer web browser now has bookmark support. You can add, remove, edit and re-order your bookmarks. Accessed with the bookmark icon on the right side of browser toolbar.
 - New DevicesAPI for registering and getting devices. The device can be anything, data the device emits to interesting parties can be anything that QVariant supports. See more from the http://realxtend.org/doxygen/device_api_page.html doxygen for examples.
 - SceneInteract: Entity action 'MouseRelease' added when mouse press is released on the entity and 'MouseScroll' when mouse is scrolled on the entity.
 - Object focus camera is back, can be used with Alt + left mouse click to object. Has UI to get back to last active camera.
 - Avatar application adds a toggle freecam/avcam button to browser toolbar. Has UI button to show when you are in freecam mode and pressing button will return you to av cam.
 - AssetCache will now more actively try to resolve if cache files are corrupted. Mainly happens on linux as its possible to open a file in write mode from more than one process. So cache files may have gotten corrupted if you were running multiple viewer/server instances that fetched same assets and accessed the asset cache.

v1.0.6 - https://github.com/realXtend/naali/compare/tundra1.0.5...tundra1.0.6
------
 - New web browser like ui for the client. You can think of Tundra as a web browser that also has 3D rendering capabilities. There is one static tab for login if you are disconnected or for the 3D content if you are connected.
 - You can jump to web tabs and have as many open as you like, both in disconnected and connected states. There is also a feature to set your home page, bookmarks will follow later. Basic idea is that tundra:// urls can be set as your home page, you can modify the browser settings to auto join the server too if youd like. You can also directly login to a world by writing tundra://server:port/?username=<your_name>[&protocol=udp/tcp] (inside [] is optional, it defaults to tcp) on any tab and it will connect to that world and jump to the 3D tab.
 - There is a new content area for tools on the browser ui. When inworld you should notice there are two icons added there Scene and Assets, so you dont have to use Shift+S/A or the top menus to access them. Inworld scripts can also add their own actions there, so depending on the world you might have more tools available to you. When disconnected the world tools are always cleared from the ui. Brief example on how to add your tools at the end.
Please give me some feed back how you like the new browser like interface. For web tabs all modern web sites should work ok (using 4.7.1 QWebKit under the hood) and has flash support as well.
 - New realxtend login portal. This utilizes our registered tundra:// protocol (currently only on windows). There are two ways it can be used 1) Login with your browser of choice (chrome/firefox/ie etc.), it will launch a Tundra client and login to the world. 2) Go to this page with your Tundra clients browser, do a login and it will connect to the world with your current client. Hosting for the actual Tundra servers is provided from Adminotech Ltd.
 - Menu items have been arranged a bit better, there is a new sub menu called settings.
 - Renderer settings are back and operational, this means ctrl+f will toggle full screen mode once again.
 - New EC_ProxomityTrigger.
 - New EC_LaserPointer.
 - UiServiceInterface was removed. See more under JavaScript Breaking Changes.
 - EC_Avatars attribute appearanceId renamed to appearanceRef. See more under JavaScript Breaking Changes.
 - New module CameraInputModule that provides web camera input. Also a test app you can access in a client from "View -> Web Camera". See how to utilize this new webcam api from http://www.realxtend.org/doxygen/class_camera_input_module.html under Detailed Description.
 - Post-processing settings are back in business. Accessed from menu View -> Post-prosessing.
 - New python irc client. Toni can post specifics about this if interested on using it. You can eg. make a Tundra server report to a IRC channel when a user logged in or out.

v1.0.5 - https://github.com/realXtend/naali/compare/tundra1.0.4...tundra1.0.5
------
 - Viewer executable now has --login support for URLs. Viewer is also registered to the operating system for handling tundra:// scheme URLs. Essentially means you can make tundra:// login links to websites and the browser will invoke Tundra viewer to login to the world with specified credentials and other data. See more details about usage from our doxygen http://www.realxtend.org/doxygen/runningnaali.html (will be updated to be there in the next 12h).
 - EC_Sounce: Added a "Play on load" boolean attribute. Set this to true if you want the sound to start playing once its loaded via the asset system.
 - class.jsl "library" is now available for Tundra JavaScripts for object orientated scripting. See more from http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/
 - Installer should now make better checks if directx9 is installed on the target machine.
 - NaaliUI got renamed to UiAPI to be consistent with other API naming. UiProxyWidget moved from Interfaces under Ui (UiAPI) project.
 - Audio got renamed to AudioAPI to be consistent with other API naming.
 - TundaLogicModules Server class has now new getters for running servers port and protocol.
 - The dialog for adding entities and assets got a small ui facelift to be consistent with our other framework windows.
 - Fixed when .txml or .mesh drops would create local entities instead of replicated onces.
 - Fixed jsmodules/startup/AutoServerStore.js script to function with the new SceneAPI.
 - Removed double console printing from headless mode.
 - Fixed physics slowdown when fps limit was defined for the mainloop/rendering.

v1.0.4 - https://github.com/realXtend/naali/compare/tundra1.0.2...tundra1.0.4
------
 - New framework APIs: SceneAPI and ConfigAPI.
 - New scene persistance script for Tundra server end users. Will load last content on startup to server and store current content on server stop. Is not enabled by default so server admins can enable it if they wish: look for jsmodules/startup/AutoServerStore.js in your install directory, read the documentation from the script.
Components Attribute metadata can now have designable boolean false. This makes the attribute not show in the editor/designer UI for the user. The attribute is still modifyable from code and will synchronize over network as before.
 - New support for QSize, QSizeF, QPoint, QPointF as Attribute types. They will be replicated over network and who in the editor UI as you would expect.
 - New EC_WebView entity component. This essentially replaces EC_3DCanvasSource with a better implementations. Features include: better preparing and rendering handling (no more grey textures on webview 3D objects), shared browsing where one user can take control of the browsing experience and his view will be synched to all clients (rendered both inworld and to their 2D preview. You need to have the components attribute 'interactive' to true and it will give you a context menu when clicked inworld to start shared browsing and showing the 2D widget.
 - SceneInteract has been moved out of RexLogic to SceneAPI. Can be accessed from framwork->Scene()->GetSceneInteract(). Now give more data on EntityClicked signal: what mouse button was pressed and the raycast result data. Still accessible from javascript with "sceneinteract.Function()" like before.
 - Improved handling on .txml scene drag and drop events. Tundra will now inspect all the scripts in the scene for additional dependencies. For the end user this is very nice as you dont have to manually copy assets that were not referenced in the actual .txml content.
 - Avatar application in scenes/Avatar got 1st person mode, to enable it zoom in to the avatar untill you hit the mode. This avatar application is just a reference implementation, but is provided so people who want avatars in their worlds can go and drop the application in to their server. Note: you might have to relogin with client after you have applied the script to your world.
 - QtUiAsset parser improvements.
 - Many framework APIs renamed to be consistent. For example InputAPI and FrameAPI.
 - Enhanced python script taiga2tundra for porting opensim style naali scene xml into tundra txml format. Useful for making the transition from taiga to tundra with existing content.
 - Mumble session object has better script support for adding channels.
 - Exposed NaaliApplication object (QApplication) from framework to scripts as "application".
 - User interface windows for Scene Struct, Asset and Entity-Component editor got a facelift. Also their shorcuts shift+a/s/e will also now toggle visibility not just show.
 - AssetAPI didn't always emit IAssetTransfer::Loaded() when the asset was in memory already. Manifested for many users with invisible avatars if you had multiple avatars with same appearance (like Jack).
 - Drag and dropping .txml files from web did not put content to actual drop/raycast position after download.
 - Mouse event propagition fix for OS X.
 - Fixed bug where EC_InputMapper was not checking if KeyEvent was alredy handled before processing and sending it forward.
 - Made Scene Struct, Asset and EC Editor windows mark their processed KeyEvents as handled. Fixed the bug where you would press shift+s/a and your avatar/camera would move.
